## Professional Experience

**Data Science Fellow\Department of Statistics\North Dakota State University (May2023-Dec2023)**
- Completed 30+ projects and labs utilizing the entire data science workflow, including data acquisition, data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory analysis, feature selection, modeling, and evaluation.
- Applied NLP and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling on Twitter data to track public discourse on public transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing evolving themes from sustainability to health and economic concerns.
- Conducted NLP (using NLTK library in Python) on hundreds of scraped Reddit posts to train several classification models to discover the main topics.
- Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately detect cracks in infrastructure images by preprocessing the dataset, selecting an optimal CNN architecture, and rigorously testing the model, achieving a detection accuracy of 95%.
- Developed an eVTOL performance model with 94% accuracy using machine learning algorithms to predict payload capacity from a comprehensive feature set. Subsequently revealed a non-linear relationship, enhancing understanding of eVTOL capabilities under varying payload conditions.
  
**Transportation Data Analyst\Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute(Jan2020-Dec2023)**
- Innovated a drone-based monitoring framework, leveraging data mining, statistical modeling, and probability analysis (Monte Carlo Simulation) in R and Python, to quantify bridge condition monitoring costs and benefits. Conducted cost-benefit analysis, and sensitivity analysis, resulting in a significant 75% reduction in inspection time and substantial long-term cost savings. 
- Developed a GIS-based level of traffic stress (LTS) map for Fargo-Moorhead and analyzed Strava's crowdsourced bicycle data, uncovering crucial insights into how the built environment influences bicycle usage and demonstrating the significant impact of bicycle facilities on usage patterns.


**Data Analyst\Institute of Urban Studies, and Planning Development(Aug2013-Sep2019)**

**Topic Modeling Analysis on Tweets**

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Topic_Modeling_Analysis_on_Tweets-blue?style=flat&logo=github)


Natural language processing by applying topic modeling to analyze tweets related to COVID-19. Leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model via the Gensim library, the analysis identifies dominant themes across tweets. Key findings include insights into public discourse on transportation, health measures, and the impact on industries like aviation during the pandemic. The project demonstrates the power of LDA in extracting meaningful patterns from social media data, providing a window into societal concerns and responses during a global crisis.

## NLP Topic Modeling LDA-based Customer Review Analysis

[![NLP-Topic Modeling](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLP--Topic%20Modeling-blue?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/TaranehAskarzadeh/Topic-Modeling-LDA-based-Customer-Review-Analysis/tree/main)


In this project, I used Reddit's API to collect data for a binary predictor model that identifies the origin subreddit of posts. The workflow involved loading data into a pandas DataFrame, cleaning the text (lowercasing, removing punctuation/stopwords, lemmatizing), and then leveraging Gensim to prepare the data for LDA analysis. After training the LDA model on this preprocessed corpus, I utilized pyLDAvis for topic visualization, making the model's findings accessible and interpretable. This streamlined approach effectively combined NLP and machine learning to classify subreddit content accurately.
