## NLP Topic Modeling LDA-based Customer Review Analysis

[![NLP-Topic Modeling](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLP--Topic%20Modeling-blue?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/TaranehAskarzadeh/Topic-Modeling-LDA-based-Customer-Review-Analysis/tree/main)


In this project, I used Reddit's API to collect data for a binary predictor model that identifies the origin subreddit of posts. The workflow involved loading data into a pandas DataFrame, cleaning the text (lowercasing, removing punctuation/stopwords, lemmatizing), and then leveraging Gensim to prepare the data for LDA analysis. After training the LDA model on this preprocessed corpus, I utilized pyLDAvis for topic visualization, making the model's findings accessible and interpretable. This streamlined approach effectively combined NLP and machine learning to classify subreddit content accurately.
